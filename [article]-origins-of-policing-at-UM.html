          <p><span style="color: inherit;">On Tuesday, members of </span><a data-cke-saved-href="http://bit.ly/UMsafetynotcops" href="http://bit.ly/UMsafetynotcops">Safety Not Cops</a><span style="color: inherit;">&nbsp;gave a presentation on student activism and campus policing at the University of Michigan.&nbsp;</span></p></p><p>The programming came as apart of programming put on in commemoration of the 55th anniversary of the Black Action Movement (BAM) strike, which shook the foundations of the University of Michigan.&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Student Protest:</strong><br></u></p><p>To give a backdrop of the student movement at U-M, the 1970s and 80s were highlighted as key periods in which sustained organizing, particularly from and among Black students, opened up a period of patterned policing of students. BAM I, which demanded 10% Black enrollment among other things, organized an 18-day strike, lowering attendance by 75%. As a result, then-president Robben Fleming <strong>stationed Ann Arbor police on campus.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong></strong>The presentation then covered the 80s, which saw large student unrest against amerikan imperialism's role overseas, with protests of the visit of George H.W Bush, amerikan support for apartheid in South Africa, and the greeting of United Nations Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick and&nbsp;Attorney General Edwin Meese with eggs and snowballs.&nbsp;<br></p><p>1987 marked a crucial point in student activism, with the formation of the United Coalition Against Racism (UCAR) in the face of heightened racial targetting of Black students on campus from racist students, faculty, and administration alike.

            </p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://africanactivist.msu.edu/record/210-849-32014/" href="https://africanactivist.msu.edu/record/210-849-32014/">https://africanactivist.msu.edu/record/210-849-32014/</a><br></p><p>UCAR's once again brought to the forefront Black enrollment, which was still far lower than what BAM I fought for, also demanding the removal of racist students from dorms, tuition waivers for minority students, and other demands. In March of 1987, UCAR occupied the presidents office for 18 hours after the Universities failure to meet their demand deadline.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong><u>Creation of Campus Police:</u></strong><br></p><p>Despite UCAR coming to an agreement with the University, the climate of racism on campus persisted. Seizing the opportunity, then-president Harold Shapiro allowed the shared governance bylaw to expire, meaning university regulations no longer had to be approved by the regents, student government, and faculty senate. Using the newfound power that came in the absence of shared governance, the university administration pursued the creation of an armed police force in 1988. Their reasoning was to control and supress events like the UCAR occupation a year earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, in 1988, two university security guards were set to be deputized, marking the foundation of a campus police force.&nbsp;<strong><u></u></strong><u></u><br></p><p>Growing in numbers, the presentation showed how U-M went from relying on 10 Ann Arbor police officers on campus in 1979, to today's Division of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) [this includes U-M Police Department], which employs hundreds.&nbsp;<strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p><b><u>Moving to Today:</u></b></p><p><u></u>The presentation highlighted how the creation of campus police only opened<span style="font-size:16px;"> up a period of abolitionist struggle, i.e the "dismantling systems of punishment, surveillance, and control—and replacing them with structures that genuinely support community safety, care, and wellbeing."&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Chivo,sans-serif"><span style="color:#333333">In particular, the Graduate Employee Organization (GEO) strike on campus brought to the forefront the abolition of campus police as a demand in their 2020/21 contract campaign.&nbsp;​​​​​​​</span></span></span></p>

          <p>Furthermore, the Pro-Palestine movement on campus brought to the forefront once again the reality of campus policing. DPSS crackdown on demonstrators resulting in multiple injuries, arrests, and racialized criminalization of protesters only show the true face of campus policing. Furthermore, the usage of pepper spray on protesters and the subsequent felony charges brought down by Michigan Attorney-General Dana Nessel only reinforce this trend.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong style="color: inherit;"><u>Discussion:</u></strong></p><p><strong><u></u></strong><u></u>After the presentation, breakout discussions were held on questions regarding what safety actually looks like, and what role campus policing has played in our experience on campus.&nbsp;<br></p><p>A popular sentiment in discussions was the low level of mental health support students receive in contrast to the overwhelming cop presence on campus. It was also highlighted how University procedure for mental health crises amongst students is to call DPSS, only further perpetuating militarization of campus.&nbsp;Participants also highlighted the harm caused by the policing system when responding to these mental health concerns.<br></p>
