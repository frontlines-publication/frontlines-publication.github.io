<h1>Orienting Resistance</h1>                  
    <h3>Responding to "You Would Be Stoned In Palestine"</h3>

  <p>At the University of Michigan, the Central Student Government (CSG) was recently swept by the Shut It Down Party, which had run on a single-issue platform: to shut down student government operations until the university divests $6 billion in holdings in the military industrial complex, and Israel by extension. Immediately, the Shut It Down Party’s success was challenged via the student government’s legal apparatus, a challenge it eventually prevailed over. In the limbo between the Shut It Down student-electoral sweep, and the conclusion of the student-court proceedings, a CSG meeting convened, during which it accepted comments from the public. One commenter, in an off-script moment during her rehearsed tirade against the Shut It Down Party, uttered the following:</p>
  <p><em>“...Something I’ve noticed that is really interesting, that I’d like to point out, is that a lot of you are queers, are “Gays for Palestine”. And that’s really funny because you know that the [inaudible] literally stone you.” </em></p>
  <p>The rest of her speech was laughable, empty drivel aimed at insulting the integrity of the Shut It Down candidates, implying that by being voted into control of CSG, an extracurricular that primarily serves as resumé padding for politically ambitious undergraduates, they were engaged in, her words, “white-savior narcissistic groupthink”: an uninteresting and shallow critique unworthy of serious attention. </p>
  <p>However, the commenter’s notion that “you”, meaning queer activists in support of Palestine, “would be stoned there”, struck me as particularly insidious rhetoric, sticking with me long after  the Shut It Down Party cleared the first round of its student-judiciary concerns. Here follows the fleshed out analysis of that commenter’s notion: “You Would Be Stoned In Palestine.”</p>
  <h3>Part I</h3>
  <p>What exactly does the Zionist refrain, “if you’re queer, you would be oppressed in Palestine”, meant to entail? Partially, it is to imply that queer anti-Zionist activism is not motivated by queer self-interest, and thus must be motivated by something else. Many find that this implication is easily debatable in the light of the oft-cited truth that queer Gazans’ lives are ruined or ended by the outcomes of Zionist ideology at a rate that dwarves the violence resulting from intra-cultural homophobia. Genuine activists showing solidarity with queer Palestinians realize they must start with stopping the literal bombs raining down upon them. However, the ground Zionists seek to gain with this particular implication seems to be that queer anti-Zionists, instead of being motivated by queer identity-politics, must be motivated by antisemitism or left groupthink, which is ultimately perceived by those of us who know better as a clumsy projection of the Zionist’s cognitive dissonance.</p>
  <p>This form of Zionist rhetoric belongs to a broader propagandistic tendency called pinkwashing, which is the cynical tactic of pointing to a group’s relative legal or cultural tolerance of queer lifestyles to provide broad justification for that group's conduct towards a “less tolerant” other. Even as Israel refuses to legalize same-sex (or interfaith) marriage within its borders, pinkwashing frequently surfaces as a popular rhetorical strategy amongst Zionist ideologues. I think it’s both interesting and necessary to push this line of thought to its conclusions. Suppose that queer Palestinians do, in fact, experience a disproportionately high amount of hate and violence. How would a Zionist, like the CSG commenter, explain this phenomenon?</p>
  <p>The ideology of Zionism insists that there is something fundamentally true of Palestinians, or Arabs in totality, that serves as grounds for their expulsion and subjugation at the hands of Israel; meanwhile Zionism’s broad range of adherents struggle to find consensus on the moral implications of their history or the character of the reality it has directly imposed. Many cite religious justifications, extrapolating justification from textual sources, while others hunker themselves into the present moment, simultaneously co-opting progressive language and insisting that they’re pragmatic humanists who only want what’s best for everyone now, while waiving thorough understanding of the history of how this moment came to be. As Zionism evolves into its genocidal modern reality, the manner in which the ideology justifies itself depends increasingly on the willful ignorance of recent history: rather, it extends itself beyond the reach of its critics by fixating on biblical history, waiving some of the rigorous standards expected of modern histories, or by decontextualizing the contemporary elements of resistance to Zionism. </p>
  <p>It is from these anachronistic fixations that the layman Zionist notion of categorical Arab “backwardness” is derived. Paired with contemporary liberal values, the commenter’s peculiar critique of Palestinian homophobia becomes possible. However, in asking a Zionist to explain the existence of any negative cultural quality that they might ascribe to Palestine, they are likely to immediately cite something like fundamentalism or Islamism. If you ask them why these currents are relevant in Palestine, or elsewhere, Zionists are confronted with two options: they must either attribute these currents to a coherent historical basis, or to something inherent to the “kind of people” Palestinians/Arabs are. Many do a spectacularly awful job at pretending to choose the first, while many others simply opt for the latter.</p>
  <p>Zionists who choose the first option face a problem, in that any honest historical analysis of the roots of fundamentalism/etc in Palestine lends itself to the rationalization of these currents in the face of the pressures that produced them. For example, the rise of Hamas in Palestine was directly consequential to the weakening of the PLO by the Zionist state, all while Israel had the unflinching material support of the West. There are countless historical relationships like this that shape the present reality in the Levant, realities including the absence of “progressive” attitudes, and if you trace them back to their root causes you arrive squarely at the feet of colonialism and imperialism. </p>
  <p>In order to dodge this ideologically-damning conclusion, Zionists often jump thousands of years further backwards, and say that the historical causes of the conflict between Israel and Palestine is actually an even more fundamental conflict: that between Jews and Arabs. Ironically, any historical basis for this argument also relies on some degree of biblical literalism, which has obvious overlap with the fundamentalism Zionists take such violent issue with. Never mind that this specific Zionist contention is not reciprocated, officially or otherwise, by their adversary. Hamas’s present charter reads: </p>
  <p>“Hamas affirms that its conflict is with the Zionist project and not with the Jews because of their religion. Hamas does not wage a struggle against the Jews because they are Jewish, but wages a struggle against the Zionists who occupy Palestine.” </p>
  <p>When anyone abstracts the conflict between Israel and Palestine to be a fundamentally religious conflict, they are simultaneously engaging in antisemitism and islamophobia. The notion that Jews and Arabs have “Tom and Jerry” DNA, or some set of inherent qualities that prevent them from coexisting, is simply a racist one. It reflects the attitudes that emanated from the dominant political-economic forces on the global stage as they took it: it is a thoroughly imperialist phenomenon. This simultaneous bigotry towards both Muslims and Jews is the ideological byproduct of the European, and incidentally Christian, world that felt threatened by the perceived encroachment of Judaism and Islam. That the “Christian” world has gotten its way in entrenching this bigotry has little to do with its theological qualities, but rather the brutal successes of European colonialism, and the development of its extractive political and economic relationships, or Imperialism. The ideology that justifies both the Imperialist’s and the Zionist’s antisemitism and islamophobia is the pseudoscientific, racist ideology that accompanied the West as it developed the institutions necessary to “study” the outside world, and itself: Orientalism. In order for its ideologues to justify themselves, Zionists must ignore, or unilaterally alter, their conceptions of Colonialism, Imperialism, and Orientalism, disregarding rigorously established definitions for what these systems are, and how they work, and how they apply to historically analogous examples. Simultaneously, they cede profoundly hateful arguments to Western antisemites, or make them themselves, in order to glean as much political power as they can from their role as an instrument, a colonial outpost, of Western Imperialism.  </p>
  <p>Zionism clings to this joint antisemitism/islamophobia because it protects its political state of affairs, meanwhile Zionists accept the Orientalist Western perspective on Jews and Arabs until they start taking contradictory positions, sometimes bordering on Holocaust denial. This is especially evident in a common Zionist talking point, one that insists that the animosity between Jews and Arabs not only transcended the violence of the Holocaust, but directly caused it: the story of the meeting between Hitler and the Grand Mufti. Zionists, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, cite this meeting as the moment that a Palestinian encouraged and convinced Hitler to exterminate the Jews of Germany, rather than expel them. This is simply a historical fiction: it did not happen, not least because the policy of extermination was well underway by the time the meeting between Hitler and the Grand Mufti was held. Zionists citing this fiction deny that the Holocaust started at the time that it did and for the reasons that it did. They waive the indisputable truth that the Holocaust was the product of European fascism, and European antisemitism, all to throw the greatest travesty ever suffered by the Jewish people at the feet of Palestinians, who were under the colonial control of the British in that very same moment.</p>
  <p>In summation: the dilemma that falls upon Zionists is that either the claim “Palestine has x negative quality” can be explained using evidenced historical relationships, and thus point strongly towards anti-imperialist/decolonial conclusions, or it can be explained using anti-Arab racism. This anti-Arab racism, of course, becomes muddled in the co-occurring bigotries of Orientalism and Western imperialism that formed the basis for Israel’s foundation, including an insidious and virulent antisemitism.</p>
  <h3>Part II</h3>
  <p>The Zionists’ dilemma can be traced all the way from the “you would be stoned in Palestine” comment, as it is itself a microcosm of that dilemma. </p>
  <p>Stone-throwing is a symbolic act associated with Palestinian resistance, declared as such on the volition of Palestinians themselves. The symbol is a frequent motif in Palestinian poetry and artwork, leading it to be reflected upon by an American intelligence officer, who identified stone-throwing as the symbol that “transformed (Israel) from the tiny, brave nation surrounded by hostile Arab nations to the oppressive state that condoned killing children in the street.” In 2015, legislation was passed by Israel to set a minimum sentence of three-years for stone-throwing, along with punishment for the parents of convicted children. The salience of the symbol is undeniable, immediately recognizable to anti-Zionists and Zionists alike. </p>
  <p>“Stone-throwing” is distinct from “stoning”, which is a form of capital punishment referenced in the Bible, Torah, and Quran. Traditionally, stoning was inflicted on adulterers and sexual deviants, participants in “illegal sex”. Throughout Islam’s history, stoning (Rajm) has occurred only sparingly due to the stringent conditions on which the punishment is permissible. The practice is, undeniably, the product of a violent consolidation of patriarchal power justified by theology. However, it would be remiss for us to forget that the rampant rape culture documented in the IDF is also a violent consolidation of patriarchal power, as is the growing rightist push for the prohibition of abortion in the United States. These examples aren’t intended to be “whataboutisms”, rather a reminder that patriarchy is a yet unvanquished enemy of liberation everywhere, and that how its violence manifests depends on the full historical context in which it occurs. The Bible and Torah, just like the Quran, contain elements of misogyny, and yet no one should maintain that any and all religious practices informed by these texts are functionally misogynistic. </p>
  <p>A liberal Zionist would maintain that they are not implying that all of Islam is fundamentally misogynistic and homophobic, but its derivatives co-occurring with Islamism, and Sharia Law, are. Even ignoring the fact that stoning is not a legal punishment anywhere in Palestine, asking 
a Zionist to explain how fundamentalism gained prevalence subjects them to reason in the same fashion as described in Part I, where they must either submit themselves to historical rigor, or seek ahistorical (timeless) answers about the fundamental character of Islamic societies. That stoning is only a single, seldom implemented capital punishment, used to punish adulterers (not “queers”), and a punishment that isn’t even legal in Palestine, makes the Zionist argument substituted by its reference entirely incoherent. We must then ask why Zionists tend to detract from queer antizionists by making this reference. </p>
  <p>It is possible that in referencing stoning they produce a counter-symbol, one that emulates stone-throwing, but transforms its connotations. The image of a Palestinian with a stone-in-hand is stripped of symbolism on the Palestinians’ terms: no longer is the image allowed to reembody the tale of David and Goliath, re-contextualized in Palestine’s fight against Western Zionism. That version of the image, projected into the global imagination, is not only rhetorically useless to Zionism, but also dangerous. So instead Zionists invoke the term “stoning”, primarily as a textual reference due to its lack of contemporary prevalence, and thus they work to strip the original resistance symbol of its relevant historical context. This does not mean that Zionists are doing this consciously, but rather that the use of stoning as a counter- symbol to stone-throwing holds a natural poignance among many Zionists, whose conception of the history of their political movement is, necessarily, steeped with theological salience. It is a piece of the ahistorical ideological mosaic that summarizes the Zionist attitude towards Arabs: that Arabs are categorically primitive religious bigots whose behavior they must avoid rationalizing with recent history, lest they find themselves too uncomfortably close to the truth.</p>
