I keep going, and so do my people."</em></p><p><em>“Now the time has come, mother. I saw myself storming their positions, killing them like sheep, then becoming a martyr. I saw myself in the presence of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, in the gardens of bliss, as he shouted to me, ‘Welcome, welcome!’”</em></p><p><em>-Yahya Sinwar</em></p><p>Yesterday, Yahya Sinwar was immortalized, a hero and leader of the Palestinian resistance. Despite the objective circumstances of his martyrdom, we say that Yahya Sinwar lives. We follow the lead of the resistance to celebrate this martyrdom as the ultimate sacrifice one can make for the cause. Sinwar once quoted Imam Ali saying, "There are two days in a person's life: the day when death is not your destiny, and the day when death is your destiny. On the first day, no one can harm you, and on the second day, no one can save you." He had a remarkable understanding of his role and his fate, and there is no doubt he was prepared for this moment.&nbsp;</p>  </body>

  <body><h2>The Real Face of Yahya Sinwar</h2><p>As of now, the imperialist media is crucifying an important leader of the Palestinian resistance, Yahya Sinwar. We hope to present the true face of Yahya Sinwar, a man who fought relentlessly for his people in the face of the lies spun by corporate media.&nbsp;</p><p>The common narrative is that Sinwar is a murderous hitman fueled with genocidal intent, currently public enemy #1 of global imperialism. Naturally, this is only an indication of the inability for the imperialists to fathom standing up for ones own people. Sinwar makes his true motive very clear, "All they [the children of Gaza] have known in their lives is siege and aggression. I want them to be free." We see that what Sinwar and the resistance fights for is the lifting of the siege in Gaza and the freedom of their people. Furthermore, Sinwar also addresses the prevalent narrative that the the resistance is responsible for causing problems for Palestinians, saying "the one responsible is the one who closes the doors on 2 million people, prevents them from receiving medicine and food, and deprives them of job opportunities and a decent life." It becomes clear that Sinwar always starts from the point of lifting the siege, and rationalizes the righteous actions of the resistance from that. This is the key being left out of the current corporate journalistic narrative, which purposefully neglect including the true motives of Sinwar and the resistance in fear that people will wake up to the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>The burning desire of Sinwar to free his people, and his ability to beautifully express what the resistance fights for is also absent in reports in major media on Sinwar. The humanization of this struggle is purposefully lacking. It is in the interests of the imperialists to paint the resistance in the most inhumane light as possible. Let us look again to Sinwar to hear more of this neglected aspect:<br>"I have been in prison for 25 years. Bassem [Sinwar points to one of his advisors] lost a son who was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Your translator lost two brothers. The man who served us tea: His wife died of an illness. It wasn’t a big problem. There were cuts, but there were no antibiotics. That’s how she died. Any pharmacist can treat that. Do you think that’s easy for us? Let’s give our children the freedom and life that we never had. They will be better than us. More capable of building their future and the future of their country and contributing to the service of humanity. Depriving our people of their rights for decades is what has prolonged the conflict and brought destruction to the region. Don’t deprive future generations of these rights."</p><p>Imagine if this was reported on, imagine how different the reaction to the news would be. Months ago in a conversation, Sinwar also revealed that one of his dearest wishes was to hold his&nbsp;"son Ibrahim’s hand and go buy him something from the store or the market, just like any father and son. I wish I could take my children on a beach trip to play with them on the sand, far from the eyes of the enemy and the security measures.”</p><p>His years of resistance against zionism must also be highlighted. It is little-known that Sinwar's first arrest came when he was 20, involved in the Islamic bloc student movement at the newly founded Islamic University of Gaza. Today, many Palestinian students are held in administrative detention just like Sinwar, proving his oneness with the will of the Palestinian cause and the continued struggle against siege and occupation.&nbsp;</p><p>Sinwar, who according to recent polling enjoys overwhelming support from Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza to act as the&nbsp;leader&nbsp;of the Palestinian national movement. This exposes the bankruptcy of imperialism, who posits support on the basis of "democratic means", but ignores the democratic will of people who oppose its aims. This moment affirms Mumia Abu-Jamal's analysis that corporate journalism is all about "selling soap", referring to its inability to report on the truth. We emphasize the neccesity to develop our own journalism, and our own news, to channel the truth that is already apparent to the majority of people in the world.</p><p>Sinwar endured decades of torture and brutality in the zionist prisons. Rather than allowing his soul and spirit to be crushed by the abhorrent circumstances in which he found himself, Sinwar turned prison into a trench of combat. He withstood interrogation, torture and took the opportunity to study the enemy. During his time in prison, Sinwar achieved the remarkable feat of teaching himself Hebrew, and engaging in an extensive study of the enemy's security system and repression. Translating the books of the occupiers into Arabic, he also wrote the book "Al-Majd", detailing the occupations security apparatus and intelligence efforts. It is in this book he also wrote about methods of investigation of Palestinian political prisoners. Sinwar was a shining example of the struggle for freedom of political prisoners. His freedom from zionist prisons was a result of his incredible will behind the bars of occupation, and the political victories brought by resistance.&nbsp;A zionist interrorgator who was tasked with questioning Sinwar once remarked that Sinwar told him defiantly, "One Day I'll Be in Power – and You'll Be the One Interrogated". Despite Sinwar's martyrdom, this still rings true. The cause that Sinwar was martyred fighting for will one day interrogate and inflict justice upon&nbsp;the agents of zionism and war criminals, who are&nbsp;doomed to the abhorrence of history and humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>Sinwar in 2004 also published a fiction novel that he wrote while in prison, "Thorns of Carnations." He painted a beautiful and humanizing picture of the struggle from 1967 to the Al-Aqsa Intifada, blending his own memories with the narrative of this struggle. Sinwar's ability to portray this struggle is profound, as it shows art only exists flowing from the people, and must return to the people. He emphasized at the beginning of his novel that, "Everything else is real; I have lived it, and much of it I have heard from the mouths of those w<span id="fc6a9b1bfb8d20965bad8d11e8bf9c4f-238840175727413" data-type="" title="gaff_punk" class="cp-cursor-position" style="border-color: rgb(72, 179, 117); background-color: rgb(72, 179, 117);"></span>ho themselves." Through the fiction piece, Sinwar was able to promote the historical trend towards liberation while emphasizing it flows from the Palestinian masses, and their real experiences. This novel also combats the imperialist narrative that Palestinians and the people under siege are "animalistic" and unable to engage in such intellectual ventures, much less the leader of the resistance movement. He addresses this by saying, "I would like to point out that despite all the suffering experienced by the Palestinian people, their love of life has made them one of the most educated peoples in the region."&nbsp;</p><h2>Sinwar and his Significance to the Undying Struggle Against Imperialism</h2><p>In the end, this supposed "victory" that the imperialist media and its zionist lackeys are purporting to have achieved is in fact a resounding declaration of defeat. The old order claws back against the&nbsp;inevitable development and transformation&nbsp;that will sweep it away. In nature, this phenomenon is clear, animals on the brink of death unleash an unforeseen ferocity. After this outburst, they die, as will the zionist entity inevitably perish at the hands of the people it terrorizes.&nbsp;</p><p>All the leaders of zionism will die peacefully surrounded by their family. In the end Sinwar died next to his pistol and covered in dust, a kuffiyeh wrapped around his head. intuitively, we know&nbsp;which is more profound. Sinwar’s life can be summed up in the following: he killed so that no Palestinian will need to kill again, and died at the forefront so that no Palestinian must die by the gun again. Israel’s “victory” is not immutable and will be transformed into their defeat.&nbsp;</p><p>The zionist entity and the imperialists have released images of Sinwar in his final hours in hopes of demoralizing the Palestinian resistance and its cause. However, these images will serve as a beacon of heroism and inspiration for the resistance of today and future generations. Unlike the cowardice that marks the leaders of the zionist entity and the imperialists who cower at the face of the resistance, Sinwar was unafraid to face the enemy head-on. Shattering all myths that the resistance "hides behind civilians", the images and circumstances of Sinwar's martyrdom proves that the resistance is on the frontlines against the enemy, acting as the first barrier between genocidal forces and the whole Palestinian people. Sinwar's martyrdom proved beyond doubt his incredible courage and will, fighting with blood and soul until the very end.&nbsp;</p>  </body>

  <body><p>">The children of Gaza are already emulating the images of Sinwar in his final moments, wrapped in a kuffiyeh and armed with a stick. The images of Sinwar immortalized will impress upon the Arab fighters of tomorrow and imbue them with the same spirit that led Yahya Sinwar to make the ultimate sacrifice. We honor the tens of thousands of Yahya Sinwars of tomorrow, the hundreds of thousands of Yahya Sinwars that have been martyred. Israel and the reactionary forces of the world have once again dug their graves an inch deeper.</span></span></p><p>Furthermore, Sinwar also was deeply aware of how the struggle against zionism was intrinsically linked to the internal struggle within amerika, united against a common enemy. In an interview, Sinwar once in<span id="fc6a9b1bfb8d20965bad8d11e8bf9c4f-3519027036806863" data-type="" title="gaff_punk" class="cp-cursor-position" style="border-color: rgb(72, 179, 117); background-color: rgb(72, 179, 117);"></span>sisted that we "remember the racist murder of George Floyd", emphasizing the importance of the internal struggle of Black folks in amerika. The imperialist media and reformists in our movement functionally ignore and downplay the undeniable link between internal resistance within amerika and that of the Palestinians.</span></span><br></p>  </body>

  <body><p>You will see many interpretations, condemnations, and opinions of Sinwar in the coming days. The truth is his martyrdom represents a life of sacrifice, struggle, and contribution to a struggle greater than himself. Sinwar knew this, and his dedication to the struggle for the liberation of Palestine is the best indication of such. His martyrdom, on the frontlines, wielding a weapon against the enemy, is an expression of his powerful will, and the powerful will of the Palestinian people we should all seriously resolve ourselves to take inspiration from. Cowardice is for the weak, for those whose cause is not righteous, who's cause does not push humanity forward. The ability to face death only comes with a righteous cause, with knowledge that what you fight for lives on. Sinwar was a guide and maker for tomorrow, his martyrdom being the ultimate beacon of sacrifice that our cause demands. We honor his martyrdom because it represents a parcel of a general movement to develop humanity, and rid this world of the forces that claw back transformation.&nbsp;</p><p>Yahya's sacrifice is the embodiment of Salah Jahin's verse:</p><p>ياما العدو راح يـشـوف (Oh how the enemy will suffer)<br>منكـم في نـار المـيـدان (From you in the fire of the battle)<br>والله زمــان يـا سـلاحـي (By God it has been a long time, my weapon)</p><p>Honor and Glory to Yahya Sinwar!</p><p>With blood and soul, fight to the very end!</p><p>Y<span id="fc6a9b1bfb8d20965bad8d11e8bf9c4f-4599121737394223" data-type="" title="gaff_punk" class="cp-cursor-position" style="border-color: rgb(72, 179, 117); background-color: rgb(72, 179, 117);"></span>ahya Sinwar Lives!</p>  </body>
