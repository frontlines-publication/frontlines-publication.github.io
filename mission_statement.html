    The consensus among our generation is clear: we are tired of the mainstream discourse that stands for order over justice. Frontlines is an explicitly radical publication that answers this call for a media revolution. If our media does not represent us, then we will build our own instead. In doing so, we offer our pen as another tool in the fight for global liberation--a fight whose fronts extend all the way to Ann Arbor.
